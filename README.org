#+TITLE: My Emacs Configuration

Yes, it's a poor man's Emacs configuration.

- usable front-end develop experience (react, typescript; eslint, prettier)
- great git experience (thanks for magit, the best git interface in the world!)
- org-mode for todo-list, denote for notes
- TeX editing
- +elfeed as RSS reader+


* Requirements

  - ~coreutils~ for dired (on macOS)
  - ~tree-sitter~ for syntax highlighting
  - ~ripgrep~
  - ~cmake~ for vterm
  - ~hunspell~ for flyspell
  - ~tsserver~ (from TypeScript, used in Tide)
  - ~mpv~ for fanyi.el to play sounds


* Tree-sitter

Use ~treesit-install-language-grammar~ to install tree-sitter language grammars.
On Windows, you can install the pre-compiled ones from
<https://corwin.bru.st/emacs-tree-sitter/>.
