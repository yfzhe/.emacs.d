#+TITLE: My Emacs Configuration

Yes, it's a poor man's Emacs configuration.

- usable front-end develop experience (react, typescript; eslint, prettier)
- great git experience (thanks for magit, the best git interface in the world!)
- org-mode for todo-list, denote for notes
- TeX editing
- +elfeed as RSS reader+

* Requirements

  - ~coreutils~ for dired (on macOS)
  - ~cmake~ for vterm
  - ~hunspell~ for flyspell
  - ~tsserver~ (from TypeScript, used in Tide)
