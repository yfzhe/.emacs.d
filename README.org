#+TITLE: My Emacs Configuration

Yes, it's a poor man's Emacs configuration.

- usable front-end develop experience (react, typescript; eslint, prettier)
- great git experience (thanks for magit, the best git interface in the world!)
- org-mode for todo-list, denote for notes
- TeX editing
- +elfeed as RSS reader+


* Requirements

  - ~coreutils~ for dired (on macOS)
  - ~tree-sitter~ for syntax highlighting
  - ~gcc~ for install tree-sitter grammars
  - ~ripgrep~
  - ~cmake~ for vterm
  - ~hunspell~ for flyspell
  - ~tsserver~ (from TypeScript, used in Tide)
  - ~mpv~ for fanyi.el to play sounds


* About tree-sitter grammars

Need to install tree-sitter grammars manually, with ~treesit-install-language-grammar~.
See ~treesit-language-source-alist~ also.
